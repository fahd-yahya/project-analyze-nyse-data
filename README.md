# project-analyze-nyse-data

Introduction
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.

What skills will I use?
The main goal of this project is for you to demonstrate your ability to:

interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)
use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP).
analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.
